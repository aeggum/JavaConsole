Java Console
This is a side project.  The absolute goal was to learn python to some degree.
The secondary goal is to create a 'python' or 'irb' like shell for Java, written in python.
It can be a pain to have to load up Eclipse, create a project, create a class, create main, and *then* do a quick test of something.  This should avoid that.

I started this project in February knowing very little python, then gave it up a month later and started working on it again 7/14/2013.
The plan is to start small.  Take in main input, methods, import statements, and do very little processing.
Eventually, support for classes will be added.  Methods called in the main method then won't continually be recalled on each run.

FEATURES:
I'd also like to have a typical command line 'history', so you can go back to your written methods, classes, etc.  (as is done by python and irb)
Another feature I'd like is the ability to 'save' your progress as you created it.

Why
I am fairly sure this has been done before.  I'm not trying to create the next great new thing, just trying to build a respectable application in a new language.

How
Run the Java Console by executing console.py from your command line.  If it doesn't work, let me know.  I wouldn't be surprised.
